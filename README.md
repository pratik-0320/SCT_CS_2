# SCT_CS_2
💡 Task 2 Completed – Image Encryption Tool As part of my internship at Skillcraft Technology, I built a Python tool that encrypts and decrypts images using pixel-level operations like XOR and pixel swapping. This project strengthened my skills in image processing, NumPy arrays, and secure data handling in Python
# 🖼️ Task 2: Image Encryption Tool

This project is part of my internship at **Skillcraft Technology**, where I built a simple yet effective image encryption tool using **pixel manipulation** techniques in Python.

## 🔐 Features

- **Swap Pixels**: Encrypts images by swapping pixels in a checkerboard pattern
- **XOR Encryption**: Applies an XOR operation on image pixels using a user-defined key (0–255)
- Supports both encryption and decryption by applying the same operation again
- CLI-based interface with file I/O support

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pillow numpy
```

2. Run the script:
```bash
python image_encryption.py
```

3. Choose an operation:
- Swap Pixels
- XOR Pixels (requires a key)

4. Provide the input image path and desired output path.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `Pillow` for image handling
- `NumPy` for pixel-level manipulation


💼 Developed during my internship at **Skillcraft Technology**.
